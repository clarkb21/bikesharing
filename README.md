# Citi Bike Business Analysis

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills using Tableau and analyzing bike sharing data. 
- Visualizations were created using Tableau to pursuade potential business investors to open a bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Project Overview
- Bike sharing data is transformed into interactive visualizations using Tableau. 
- Multiple graphs and maps are created to show multiple aspects of a successful bike sharing company. 
- Graphs in Tableau have filters for users to select times, genders, areas where bike sharing data is most relevant to them. 


### Challenge Overview
- The data type for the trip duration in the original data set is converted to a datetime data type using Pandas and Jupyter notebook. This allows for better analysis and visualizations in Tableau. 
- Multiple charts and maps are created to show busy times for bike utilization based on day of the week and gender. 
- The Tableau worksheets are then organized into a Tableau story with narration. 

## Results
1. Checkout times for all users can be filtered based on the time of day. The line chart shows that bikes are most frequently checked out during the morning and evening commutes.   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104038813/189180077-031077b6-dd3d-4ae6-8c71-72bf34de51fd.png)

2. The same checkout chart can also be filtered by gender and by hour of the day. Based on this chart, men use the bikes more often, but the times for men and women appear to be similar.

3. The gender breakdown shows that men make up roughly 65% of all users. Women make up 25% and the rest of the users did not put a gender down when they registered for the bike.

4. The users were categorized by whether they had signed up for a monthly subscription or not. Subscribers used the bikes more often and made up 81% of all users.

5. The most common times that the bikes were used was during commuting times in the morning and afternoons. Weekends saw more usage during the middle of the day.
