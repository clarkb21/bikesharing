# Citi Bike Business Analysis

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills using Tableau and analyzing bike sharing data. 
- Visualizations were created using Tableau to pursuade potential business investors to open a bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Project Overview
- Bike sharing data is transformed into interactive visualizations using Tableau. 
- Multiple graphs and maps are created to show multiple aspects of a successful bike sharing company. 
- Graphs in Tableau have filters for users to select times, genders, areas where bike sharing data is most relevant to them. 


### Challenge Overview
- The data type for the trip duration in the original data set is converted to a datetime data type using Pandas and Jupyter notebook. This allows for better analysis and visualizations in Tableau. 
- Multiple charts and maps are created to show busy times for bike utilization based on day of the week and gender. 
- The Tableau worksheets are then organized into a Tableau story with narration.
